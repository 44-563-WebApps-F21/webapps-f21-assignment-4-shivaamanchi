        [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under large yew tree_.]
    </h2>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
    <p class="speech CAROLINE">I believe this is the first English country house you have stayed at, Miss Worsley?

    <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>
    <P class="speech Hester">Yes, Lady Caroline.</P>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE .</h6>
    <p class="speech CAROLINE">You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>

    <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>   
    <P class="speech Hester">We have not many.</P>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
    <p class="speech CAROLINE"> Have you any country? What we should call country?</p>

    <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER.</h6>
    <p class="speech Hester">  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
        Caroline. They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
        big as France and England put together.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Smiling_.]</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
    <p class="speech CAROLINE"> Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
    <p class="stage-direction">[_To_ SIR JOHN.]</p>
    <p class="speech LADY CAROLINE">John, you should have your muffler. What is the use of
    my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>

    <h6 class="name SIRJOHN">SIR JOHN.</h6>
    <p class="speech JOHN"> I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADYCAROLINE.</h6>
    <p class="speech CAROLINE"> I think not, John. Well, you couldn’t come to a more
        charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
        damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
        little lax about the people she asks down here. [_To_ SIR JOHN.] Jane
        mixes too much. Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
        distinction. It is a privilege to meet him. And that member of
        Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>

    <p class="speech SIR JOHN"> Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.</p>
