        <h3>A Woman of no Importance</h3>
        <h2>_The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase_.

        _Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton_. 
        [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under large yew tree_.]
        </h2>

        <p>LADY CAROLINE.  I believe this is the first English country house you have stayed at, Miss Worsley?
            
            HESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.

            LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?

            HESTER.  We have not many.

            LADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?

            HESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
            Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
            big as France and England put together.

            LADY CAROLINE.  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
            [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
            my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?

            SIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.

            LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
            charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
            damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
            little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
            mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
            distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
            Parliament, Mr. Kettle—

            SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
