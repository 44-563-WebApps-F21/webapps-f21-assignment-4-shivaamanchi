        <h3>A Woman of no Importance</h3>
        <h2>_The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase_.

        _Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton_. 
        [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under large yew tree_.]
        </h2>

        <p><h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  I believe this is the first English country house you have stayed at, Miss Worsley?<br>
            
            <h6>HESTER.</h6>  Yes, Lady Caroline.<br>

            <h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?<br>

            <h6>HESTER.</h6>  We have not many.<br>

            <h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  Have you any country?  What we should call country?<br>

            <h6>HESTER.</h6>  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
            Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
            big as France and England put together.<br>

            <h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
            [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
            my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?<br>

            <h6>SIR JOHN.</h6>  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.<br>

            <h6>LADY CAROLINE.</h6>  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
            charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
            damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
            little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
            mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
            distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
            Parliament, Mr. Kettle—<br>

            <h6>SIR JOHN.</h6>  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.<br>
