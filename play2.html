            <p class="speech CAROLINE">He must be quite respectable.  One has never heard his
            name before in the whole course of one’s life, which speaks volumes for a
            man, nowadays.  But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suitable person.</p>

            <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER</h6>
            <p class="speech Hester">I dislike Mrs. Allonby.  I dislike her more than I can say.</p>

            <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE.</h6>
            <p class="speech CAROLINE">I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners like
            yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
            invited to meet.  Mrs. Allonby is very well born.  She is a niece of Lord
            Brancaster’s.  It is said, of course, that she ran away twice before she
            was married.  But you know how unfair people often are.  I myself don’t
            believe she ran away more than once.</p>
